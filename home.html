Hi! Thank you for visit my personal website :) 
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, famous people should have their own website to because, researcher or students would like to choose 
them as their idol and for making reseach for education. From personal website, the researhcer or sudents can get 
more information that can help them doing their work. As we known, in internet there are alot of information but, 
all the information are not authentic and inaccurate. Its really hard to choose which one is inaccurate information.
